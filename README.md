### Overview

### Design
#### PCB
#### Box of The Product :ice_cube:
It made from PETG fillaments that known for their water resistantance. It made with only 13.5 x 9 in centimeters which is a quite small size to be installed on every tap water.  The boxes contains from 3 parts, which are: bottom, top, and the battery cover. It's all easy and practically to use; 
1. for engineer uses: it can easily open from the **upper part** and then close back with **bolt** installed, and
2. for user uses: which repeatedly only need to **replace the battery**, users can only open the **battery cover** that place behind and then close the cover back
